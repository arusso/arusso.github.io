        <h3>Hello There.</h3>

<p>I work with computers.  I enjoy working with computers.  I enjoy making computers work for others to do things that I'm not cool enough to do (that's probably I work in higher education).</p>

<h3>Some of my Work</h3>

<p>Some of my more interesting public work is</p>

<h4>Bobbie (a mediawiki bot framework)</h4>

<p>Named after a lost friend, Bobbie is my sidekick at work.  Bobbie helps me automate the maintenance of my system documentation by helping me quickly grab data from any source I can obtain programatically, and input it with relative ease into MediaWiki.</p>

<p>Currently, I use it to create new host pages in our wiki whenever a new host is provisioned, as well as updating tags for host on a wiki page with facts from Puppet/Facter. </p>
