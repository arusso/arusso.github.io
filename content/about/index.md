Well, this is awkward...

I'm a Senior Systems Engineer at [Pixar](http://www.pixar.com) who geeks out
when people talk to him about all things tech. I'm particularly fond of building
tools to aid in automation.

When I'm not looking at pixels I enjoy making pizza, playing video games, and being dad.
